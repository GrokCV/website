abstract: Infrared small target detection has been extensively investigated by incorporating the low-rank and sparse prior into tensor decomposition frameworks. Despite its success, the said paradigm remains several limitations in complex scenes, such as: 1) the inadequate spatial-temporal information exploitation among sequential patches; 2) the incomplete suppression of the complex background interference. To mitigate the defects, this article provides a tensor decomposition method integrating spatial-temporal  sparse gradient regularization and spectral support constraint. First, we present a skillfully connected multiframe patch group (CMPG) model to explore local spatial information and adjacent interframe correlation among multiframes patches. Then, for CMPG model, a scalable tensor spectral support constraint is employed to distinctively regularize its redundant and rare components. evaluation.
