abstract: Many state of the art methods have been proposed for infrared small target detection.They work well on the images with homogeneous backgrounds and high-contrast targets.However, when facing highly heterogeneous backgrounds, they would not perform very well,


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  Many state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for infrared small target detection. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method to exploit both local and non-local priors simultaneously.
